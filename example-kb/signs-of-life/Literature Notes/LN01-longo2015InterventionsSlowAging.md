- *“Data from experimental studies in invertebrates and rodents have consistently shown that both chronic dietary restriction (DR) and mutations in nutrient and growth signaling pathways can extend longevity by 30–50%. These interventions can also lower the prevalence of age-related loss of function and multiple diseases, including tumors, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegeneration (Fontana et al., 2010). DR protects against diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, sarcopenia, and neurodegeneration of certain brain regions in rhesus monkeys and also extends lifespan (Mattison et al., 2012; Colman et al., 2014). In humans, long-term DR causes several metabolic and molecular changes that protect against age-related pathologies, including changes in markers for type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia (Cava & Fontana, 2013). Moreover, chronic DR ameliorates the expected age-associated alterations in myocardial stiffness, autonomic function, and skeletal muscle gene expression changes (Mattison et al., 2012; Cava & Fontana, 2013; Colman et al., 2014). However, the duration and severity of the DR regimen that is required for optimal benefits is not feasible for most people and is likely to be associated with undesirable side effects. Therefore, the focus of this consensus meeting in Erice was on less drastic dietary interventions and drugs that target nutrient-response pathways and mimic the effects of DR, but that are practical, realistic, and safe.”* 
- *“There was a general consensus among this panel of experts on the following points: (i) aging can be slowed by many interventions; (ii) slowing aging typically delays or prevents a range of chronic diseases of old age; (iii) dietary, nutraceutical, and pharmacologic interventions that modulate relevant intracellular signaling pathways and can be considered for human intervention have been identified. Additional potential targets will continue to emerge as research progresses; and (iv) it is now necessary to cautiously proceed to test these interventions in humans. Based on a vote taken on the last day of the workshop, the strategies believed to be most promising by the panel of invited experts and authors of this manuscript are as follows: 1 Pharmacological inhibition of the GH/IGF-1 axis 2 Protein restriction and Fasting Mimicking Diets 3 Pharmacological inhibition of the TOR -S6K pathway 4 Pharmacological regulation of certain sirtuin proteins and the use of spermidine and other epigenetic modulators 5 Pharmacological inhibition of inflammation 6 Chronic metformin use These choices were based in part on: (i) consistent evidence for their pro-longevity effects in simple model organisms and rodents; (ii) evidence for their ability to prevent or delay multiple age-related diseases and conditions; and/or (iii) clinical evidence for their safety in small mammals and/or nonhuman primates. Below, we present the salient points related to each of the promising strategies. Other ideas discussed at the meeting are described elsewhere (Gems, 2014).”* [@longo2015InterventionsSlowAging, p. 498] [](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/38HZ6EU7?page=2&annotation=9ZVKLRDE)
