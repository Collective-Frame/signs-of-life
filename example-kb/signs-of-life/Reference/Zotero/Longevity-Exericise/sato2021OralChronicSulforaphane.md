title: Abstract
Objective
Sulforaphane is a phytochemical that is commonly found in broccoli and broccoli sprouts. However, whether chronic sulforaphane ingestion suppresses heavy resistance exercise–induced muscle damage parameters in humans remains unknown. Therefore, this study investigated the effects of oral chronic sulforaphane ingestion on heavy resistance exercise–induced muscle damage parameters.
Methods
The study had a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Ten healthy young men (age: 22.0 ± 0.3 y; body weight: 62.6 ± 2.4 kg; height: 171.0 ± 0.1 cm) were administered placebo or sulforaphane (30 mg/d) for 4 wk at the first trial, then after a 4-wk washout period, the participants were administered the opposite treatment for 4 wk at the second trial. The participants were subjected to heavy resistance exercise (bench press, 85% of one-repetition maximum for three times with eight repetitions) after each administration, and blood samples were collected before and at 30 min and 24 h after each exercise session.
Results
In this study, 4 wk of sulforaphane intake decreased plasma levels of creatine kinase, especially creatine kinase levels from 30 min to 24 h and baseline to 24 h. Moreover, the change in interleukin-6 levels significantly decreased from baseline to 30 min on prolonged intake of sulforaphane.
Conclusions
Together, these findings suggest that the oral chronic intake of sulforaphane suppressed the heavy resistance exercise–induced increase in muscle damage parameter and expression of inflammatory cytokines. The chronic use of sulforaphane may be a novel therapeutic candidate for the prevention of muscle damage in athletes training daily with high-intensity exercise.
